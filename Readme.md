# Bank Marketing – Decision Tree Classifier 🌳📊

This project is part of **Task 03** of a Virtual Internship in Data Science.  
The goal is to build a **Decision Tree classification model** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)**
- Target Variable: `y` (Subscription: yes / no)

---

## 🎯 Objective
To predict customer subscription behavior using a Decision Tree classifier and analyze the key factors influencing the decision.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Encoded categorical variables  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Built and trained a Decision Tree classifier  
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
7. Visualized the decision tree and feature importance
